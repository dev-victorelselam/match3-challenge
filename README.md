# match3-challenge

Hello! I'm Victor and here are some important instructions:

1 - For tests: I made some Unit tests with my Unit Test Framework (https://github.com/dev-victorelselam/unity-runtime-test)
To play those tests, you just need to open the respective scene and hit Play in Unity Editor (Assets/Tests)

2 - All game configs are in a Scriptable Object located at Assets/Resources/Settings/GameSettings

3 - The main scene to play is GameScene, located at Assets/Scenes/GameScene
